# PokeAPI with React Router

This is a project I build to practice working with React Router DOM.

### Components

- [x] Header/main nav <br />
- [x] Footer <br />
      [ ] List of PokeCards + pagination <br />
      [ ] Individual PokeCard <br />
      [ ] Page to display single card <br />

### Overall Data flow

[x] Have header and footer on all pages <br />
[x] Fetch data from API, then create PokemonCard component for each (PokemonList.js & PokemonCard.js) <br />
[x] Include Link to view that specific Pokemon in more detail (PokemonCard.js) <br />
[ ] On home page, display list of Pokemon Cards with pagination buttons (PokemonList.js) <br />
[ ] Handle state of next/previous buttons (PokemonList.js) <br />
