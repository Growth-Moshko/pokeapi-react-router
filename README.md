# PokeAPI with React Router

This is a project I build to practice working with React Router DOM.

### Components

[ ] Header/main nav <br />
[ ] List of PokeCards + pagination <br />
[ ] Individual PokeCard <br />
[ ] Page to display single card <br />
[ ] Footer <br />

### Overall Data flow

- Have header and footer on all pages
- On home page, display list of Pokemon Cards with pagination buttons (PokemonList.js)
- Fetch data from API, then create PokemonCard component for each (PokemonList.js & PokemonCard.js)
- Handle state of next/previous buttons (PokemonList.js)
- Include Link to view that specific Pokemon in more detail (PokemonCard.js)
